    <h1>NEWARK</h1>
    <div>
    <P class="error">New York, constituent state of the United States of America, one of the 13 original colonies and 
        states.</P> 
       
    <p class="success">York is bounded to the west and north by Lake Erie, the Canadian province of Ontario, 
        Lake Ontario, and the Canadian province of Quebec; to the east by the New England states of Vermont,
        Massachusetts, and Connecticut; to the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean and New Jersey; and to the 
        south by Pennsylvania. The capital is Albany.</p>

    <p> the 1960s New York was the countrys leading state in nearly all population, cultural, and 
        economic indexes.</p> 
        
    <p> displacement by California beginning in the middle of that decade was caused 
        by the enormous growth rate that has persisted on the West Coast rather than by a large decline in 
        New York itself. Texas overtook New York as the second most populous state in 2000.</p>
         
    <p> New York remains one of the most populous states in the country, and its gross economic product exceeds those
        of all but a handful of countries throughout the world. </P>

<h1>ABOUT NEWARK</h1>
<p>Both the New England and the Southern colonies had a great deal more to do with the 
    movement toward revolution and with stabilizing the new country during its early decades 
    than did New York, but, once the states growth got under way, it attained a breakneck pace</p>
